# BUDining
The BU Dining website is damn near useless for celiac and vegetarian me. From 0 calorie water cookies to whole wheat "gluten free" bread, and a lack of proper filters, matters had to be taken into my own hands.

## Launch
My plan is to eventually host this either on render or a DO droplet but for now, you can clone it and
`python3 app/__init__.py`

## Preview
